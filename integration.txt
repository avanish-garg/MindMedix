--- I am not including user and Auth routes in the repo and will be take caring of them later
---Usercontroller and authcontroller inside the the controller are not added in the repo from Devanshi wand however it should be considered lately
db config also not added
---User model,login model offcourse is not added too(check useraccount model)
--- we can also update the feedback schema or make it update by any of the team mate
--- Have to merge my, Aastha's & Devanshi's package json and lock files and then install the dependensies to the repo
--- moved html files from public folder to our html folder
--- Devanshi what she has done is made different JS files for each test like index, forgot pass, login, server, tip, etc so what I have to do is to merge them all under our server.js or distribute our files too!

Integration flow ---
first of all I think I need to update my userschema acc to all three of ours and even before that I think wen need to first take a deep breath and check for the possible outcomes with our findings so lets first reseach and make our axe stronger and then we'll mmove on to breaking of the pad;)
